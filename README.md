# Unexpected Null Handling in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to unexpected null handling in a JavaScript function.  The `foo` function does not explicitly check for null values, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function exhibits unexpected behavior when null values are passed as arguments.  This can lead to errors, unexpected results, or silent failures, making debugging difficult. The root cause is the lack of explicit null checks and appropriate handling for null inputs.

## Solution

The provided solution introduces explicit null checks within the function to manage null values correctly.  This enhances the robustness and reliability of the function, preventing potential errors and ensuring predictable behavior in various scenarios.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` to see the buggy code.
3. Run the buggy code with null values as input. Observe the unexpected behavior.
4. Open `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected code.
5. Run the corrected code with null values as input. Observe the improved behavior.
